Just for the record, I have zero formal training, education, work experience in full stack development or webdesign
but i've always been confident in whipping up a mean calculator in C+ or python. This site was purely a spur of the moment impulse project
but getting to code everything from scracth (I used the default astro blog template) is pretty neat. 

Newfound respect for the other nerds that do this full time. Im gonna stick to mashing up flies in a test tube thank you.

if anyone wants to help add features... I really need it javascript is a nightmare
